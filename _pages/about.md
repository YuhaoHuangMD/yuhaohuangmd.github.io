I am a resident and post-doctorate researcher in the <a href="https://dura.stanford.edu/residents/yuhao-huang.html">Department of Neurosurgery</a> at Stanford University. As a physician-scientist with a focus on signal processing and neural electrophysiology, I work with multimodal datasets to understand how brain signals correlate with human behavior. I am interested in using computer vision and machine learning to parse neural correlates of behavior under naturalistic settings. Another area of interest involves building robust neuro-modulatory treatments for functional disorders and epilepsy. I received by BSc at University of Alberta and my MD at Stanford University.
