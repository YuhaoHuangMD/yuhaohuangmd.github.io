I am a resident and researcher in the Department of Neurosurgery at Stanford University School of Medicine. As a physician-scientist and signal processor with focus on neuroscience and neural electrophysiology, I work with multimodal datasets to understand how brain signals relate to human behavior. I am interested in using state of art tools in computer vision and machine learning to parse neural correlates of behavior under naturalistic settings in effort to build robust neuro-modulatory treatments. I majored in biochemistry at University of Alberta, obtained my MD at Stanford University, and currently doing my residency and post-doc in neurosurgery with a focus in functional disorders and epilepsy at Stanford University.
